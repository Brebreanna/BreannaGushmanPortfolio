      <h1>About Me ð–¹­</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Breanna, a UX Designer and Computer Engineering senior at UMass Amherst. I'm passionate about creating inclusive, intuitive digital products. I believe that digital experiences should be as inclusive as they are intuitive. Whether Iâ€™m prototyping in Figma or coding in Python, I love blending design thinking with technical skills to build accessible, human-centered products that truly serve people.

My journey began with building personal websites and grew into a deep curiosity about how people interact with technology. That curiosity evolved into a passion for solving real-world problems through thoughtful UX design and functional engineering.

Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, exploring new creative hobbies, and having conversations with people from all walks of life. Iâ€™m always excited to learn something new and build things that make a real impact.
