      <h2>Role</h2>
      <p><strong>UX Designer (Solo)</strong><br>
         Team: 4 members • Timeline: 24 hours (Hackathon) • Tools: Figma
      </p>

      <h2>Problem & Goal</h2>
      <p>College students often end up staring at a half‑stocked fridge with no clue what to make. With classes, work, and tight budgets, meal planning becomes one more stressor.</p>
      <p>Our goal: design a tool that makes deciding what to cook <em>fast, fun, and affordable</em>. We explored two directions—(1) a swipe‑based recipe database and (2) an AI ingredient scanner—while keeping the experience approachable and rewarding.</p>
      <p>We modeled the interaction after familiar dating apps so users could browse recipes quickly without decision fatigue. The primary persona was <strong>Dove</strong>, a busy student working part‑time who needs an encouraging, low‑friction path from “what’s in my fridge?” to “I’m cooking this.”</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Discover meals quickly with swipe‑based browsing</li>
        <li>Turn saved recipes into simple grocery lists</li>
        <li>Build confidence in the kitchen without expert skills</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Approach & Research</h2>
      <p>I led the design from ideation to high‑fidelity mockups. We collaborated in Figma and tracked tasks in Notion. With only 24 hours, I prioritized fast, thoughtful decisions.</p>
      <p>I evaluated Tasty, Mealime, and HelloFresh to learn from strong visuals and inclusive recipes, and to spot gaps—many tools assume prior cooking knowledge and don’t balance fun with usability. To maximize speed, I skipped wireframes and moved straight into high‑fidelity design.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Personalization:</strong> Onboarding collects dietary goals and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural inclusivity:</strong> Diverse cuisines and dietary needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Clarity & warmth:</strong> Soft palette, playful icons, and large tap targets.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Screens & Design Decisions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Onboarding & Preferences:</strong> Lightweight flow with large, rounded controls to reduce friction.</li>
        <li><strong>Recipe Cards:</strong> Show cook time, calories, and dietary icons for fast scanning.</li>
        <li><strong>Swipe‑Based Feed:</strong> Vertical, minimalist browsing to minimize choice overload.</li>
        <li><strong>Recipe Detail:</strong> Step‑by‑step instructions with clear hierarchy for in‑kitchen use.</li>
        <li><strong>Cooking Mode Checklist:</strong> Action‑based steps; high contrast and generous spacing.</li>
        <li><strong>Figma Structure:</strong> Auto‑layout and consistent spacing for rapid iteration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><em>Usability note:</em> We identified that slightly larger icon buttons would further improve one‑handed use on smaller phones.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Outcome</h2>
      <p>In 24 hours, we delivered a high‑fidelity mobile prototype that reimagines meal planning for students. Cookr was praised for its clean UI, playful visuals, and focused scope. I completed six polished screens and owned all UX/UI design decisions. The swipe interaction felt intuitive and supported both browsing and in‑kitchen flows.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>Cookr reinforced the value of <strong>clarity over complexity</strong>. Under time pressure, I focused on essentials and collaborated closely with engineers to keep the design feasible. I delivered prototypes early to keep development moving and learned how much icon sizing and touch targets matter for accessibility.</p>
      <p>If I had more time, I’d add an image‑recognition feature: snap your ingredients, get recipe suggestions—keeping the playful tone while expanding utility.</p>

      <h2>Final Design & Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightweight onboarding with personalized cooking preferences</li>
        <li>Swipe‑based recipe browsing for low‑effort decisions</li>
        <li>Recipe cards with cook time, calories, and dietary icons</li>
        <li>Checklist‑style instructions optimized for hands‑free, in‑kitchen use</li>
        <li>Soft color palette and friendly iconography to invite exploration</li>
        <li>Accessibility: high contrast, large tap targets, clear hierarchy</li>
