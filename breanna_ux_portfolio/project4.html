    <h2>Grow Up Green</h2>
    <p>Grow Up Green is a responsive resale platform designed to simplify secondhand shopping for parents. Built with a focus on trust, accessibility, and environmental reward, it addresses user and business needs by creating a frictionless experience that encourages platform engagement and sustainable behavior.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>As a first-time aunt, I saw both of my sisters struggle to afford baby clothes while juggling tight budgets and the constant growth spurts of young children. Around the same time, I was actively selling on Depop and noticed a clear gap in the market. There wasn’t a secondhand shopping platform designed specifically for kids that felt easy to use, trustworthy, and values-driven.</p>
    <p>Although many parents and caregivers are open to buying secondhand, most existing platforms make the experience difficult. Through early conversations and personal observation, I identified three key barriers:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The process of browsing and listing takes too much time</li>
      <li>Concerns about hygiene and seller trust create hesitation</li>
      <li>There is little emotional or social incentive to choose used over new</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This led me to a guiding question:</p>
    <blockquote>How might we design a secondhand shopping experience for kids that is intuitive, trustworthy, and emotionally rewarding?</blockquote>
    <p>I imagined a platform that rebrands secondhand shopping as something modern and purposeful. Inspired by the free-exchange model of Facebook Marketplace and the positive reinforcement used in apps like Ecosia and Forest, my goal was to create a space where parents feel good about their choices. I wanted the experience to support them financially, emotionally, and environmentally.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>User Research and Insights</h2>
    <p>To uncover the motivations and pain points of secondhand shoppers, I conducted five structured, in-person interviews. Each participant was either a parent, grandparent, or caregiver responsible for at least one child. By using the same set of questions across all sessions, I was able to collect consistent qualitative data while still allowing space for unique user stories to emerge.</p>
    <p>Participants were guided through a simulated shopping task on Grow Up Green. They were asked to search for gender-specific clothing, read product descriptions, add an item to their cart, and walk through the checkout process. At each step, I observed their behavior and asked them to compare the experience with other secondhand platforms they had used.</p>
    <h3>Key Insights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Trust is essential. Parents need clear indicators that sellers are verified, items are clean, and listings are authentic.</li>
      <li>Efficiency drives usage. All five users said they would leave a platform if they could not find what they needed in just a few minutes.</li>
      <li>Detailed descriptions build confidence. Users consistently wanted better clarity around sizing, condition, and return policies.</li>
      <li>Filtering must be simple. Several users struggled with overly complex filter options and expressed frustration with cluttered layouts.</li>
      <li>Emotion enhances retention. Participants were more likely to return to a platform that made them feel good about supporting sustainability or helping other families.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Persona Snapshot</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Zari<br>
       <strong>Age:</strong> 28<br>
       <strong>Role:</strong> Full-time working mom with two toddlers under four.<br>
       <strong>Goals:</strong> Save money, reduce environmental impact, and complete purchases quickly.<br>
       <strong>Frustrations:</strong> Overwhelming layouts, vague product details, and platforms that do not feel trustworthy.<br>
       <strong>Quote:</strong> “If it’s not fast, I’m not using it. I need to get in and out with confidence.”</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Storyboard</h2>
    <p>To bring the user journey to life, I created a storyboard centered on Clarke, a caregiver persona developed through user interviews. The storyboard highlights Clarke’s experience using Grow Up Green in two scenarios: a quick interaction and a full journey.</p>
    <p>The first storyboard shows Clarke completing a single task—opening the app, signing up, browsing, and checking out with ease. The second storyboard illustrates a more emotional path, starting with frustration on other platforms and ending with a rewarding, trust-driven experience on Grow Up Green.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>I began the design process with digital sketches created in Pic Collage, using them to quickly visualize layout ideas and user flow. From there, I translated the concepts into low-fidelity wireframes and connected them to simulate a functioning app prototype. This allowed me to test how the experience felt from the user’s perspective before moving into high-fidelity design.</p>
    <h3>Key Design Priorities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Effortless navigation: minimal steps, grid-based browsing.</li>
      <li>Smart recommendations inspired by TikTok’s logic.</li>
      <li>User profiles with environmental impact stats.</li>
      <li>Platform-specific visual design: bold and fast for mobile, calm and structured for web.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Visual and Accessibility Choices</h2>
    <p>I chose a forest green and spring green color palette to align with the eco-conscious mission. Accessibility was baked into every decision, ensuring icons were labeled and color contrast checked for clarity.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Usability Testing and Iteration</h2>
    <h3>What I Observed</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Navigation needed rethinking—users often skipped the homepage.</li>
      <li>Visual structure impacted flow—spacing and hierarchy needed refinement.</li>
      <li>Overall usability was high, but polish was lacking—needed more delightful interactions.</li>
      <li>Checkout performed reliably—most users completed without assistance.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Iterations Based on Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Clearer navigation labels and search repositioning.</li>
      <li>Improved spacing for filters and product cards.</li>
      <li>Simplified dense screens on mobile.</li>
      <li>Retested all prototype flows for bugs.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Final Design and Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>User profile pages with eco-impact tracking.</li>
      <li>Easy item listing flow.</li>
      <li>Responsive mobile and desktop layouts.</li>
      <li>Smart filtering and wishlist.</li>
      <li>Free item section (shipping only).</li>
      <li>Playful, positive visual tone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike most resale platforms, Grow Up Green goes beyond clothing and includes a variety of kids’ items. It ties reselling to visible environmental impact, filling a real gap in the market.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p>This project taught me the importance of designing alongside users, not just for them. Observing real interactions helped me drop assumptions and focus on actual needs. Some testers even asked when it would be available in app stores. I grew most in prototyping, iteration, and developing user stories—and learned the power of simplicity.</p>
